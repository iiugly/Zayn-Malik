<u><strong>Lyrics:</strong></u>
<br>Nostalgia, what a funny feeling
<br>I feel depleted from feelings I've been revealin'
<br>It's do or die, I'm not goin' willing
<br>But when it's time, wrap in white linen
<br>I rap this, I say it for my sanity
<br>Whatever the calamity, I did this for myself
<br>
<br>Fuck all of your fantasies
<br>You're a snake, fell of the ladder
<br>I prefer speakin' in analogies
<br>I've had enough of all this wet
<br>And I can't trust that you're my family
<br>I don't know what's next
<br>The brain dead, that I never miss
<br>
<br>My brain lives with the cannabis
<br>Can I resist the dark abyss?
<br>Leave a mark on this with no start, just exist
<br>My mind's in a prism shape
<br>And in times like a prison state
<br>There's no right that I feel of late
<br>There's no light if my view's at stake
<br>And which life should I choose to take
<br>
<br>What's left? Is it room or space?
<br>They are rumors we have to face
<br>I prefer sooner than after late
<br>I seen actors after BAFTA's be more straight
<br>I mean down the barrel
<br>I hear 'em sing, it's the same carol
<br>They're tryna sprint in a long run, Mo Farah
<br>
<br>They're tryna fix when it's long gone, don't bother
<br>There's no other, the thoughts shudders through most lovers
<br>I wanna bed you, but still sleep is death's, cousin
<br>So two weeks is now four dozen
<br>Years that pass by, can't press no rewind
<br>Just watch my life by and lock the right ties
<br>
<br>Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me
<br>Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin'
<br>Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me
<br>Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me
<br>
