    Zain Javadd Malik, known mononymously as Zayn, is a British singer. Born and raised in
    <br> 
    Bradford, Malik auditioned as a solo contestant for the British music competition television 
    <br>
    series The X Factor in 2010. After being eliminated, Malik was brought back to the 
    <br>
    competition to form the five-piece boy band One Direction, which went on to become one of 
    <br>
    the best-selling boy bands of all time. He left the group in March 2015 and signed a solo 
    <br>
    recording contract with RCA Records. Adopting a more alternative R&B music style on his 
    <br>
    first solo studio album, Mind of Mine (2016), and its lead single, "Pillowtalk", Malik became 
    <br>
    the first British male artist to debut at number one in both the UK and US with his debut 
    <br>
    single and album. His subsequent collaborative singles "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" with 
    <br>
    Taylor Swift and "Dusk Till Dawn" featuring Sia were met with international success. Malik 
    <br>
    released his second studio album, Icarus Falls, in 2018, followed by his third album, Nobody 
    <br>
    Is Listening, in 2021. Malik has received several accolades, including an American Music
    <br>
    Award and a MTV Video Music Award. He is the only artist to have won the Billboard Music 
    <br>
    Award for New Artist of the Year twice, receiving it once as a member of One Direction in 
    <br>
    2013 and again in 2017 as a soloist.
